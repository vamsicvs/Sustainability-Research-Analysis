This analysis performs a Natural Language Processing (NLP) and ESG modelling analysis of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) sustainability reports. It will be sought to derive insightful information out of the content of these reports and associate the score obtained with the calculating of ESG.
Data loading and Data Preparation. The required libraries like pandas, matplotlib, nltk, and many more are installed into the system and imported. These are the tools necessary to work with data, do text analysis, and visualize. The ESG sustainability reports dataset is downloaded in a pandas DataFrame. This is primary data to be analyzed.

Data Extraction and Cleaning
This analysis also provides the overview of the data (name, description, form). This aids to perceive the columns present and the general parameters of the information. Starting with data cleaning, the Unnamed:0 column was dropped because it does not provide much more meaningful impact in the dataset. Later than, missing values are verified by which the occurrence of no missing values is also good as data was complete in the columns checked.
Descriptive statistics are also presented, which is an indication of how the numerical data, as well as ESG scores are distributed. Unique values and frequencies of variables representing filename, ticker and year are presented. This provides a sense of the companies and the years captured in the data set and assures that each file is representing a distinct ticker and year.

ESG Score Analysis
Histograms are done to provide a visualization of how each of the E, S, G, and Total ESG scores curves. This shows the distribution and frequency of the score indicating how firms are overall performing on each aspect. Such as the case of an E score distribution skewed to lower values, one might point out that environmental performance is overall poorer in analyzed companies.
A line plot illustrates the pattern of mean ESG rating over the years. This assists in determining whether there is an overall increase or drop in the ESG performance over the years on the dataset. The result that indicates an upward trend in total ESG score may imply that greater attention and more thorough reporting are being paid to sustainability.

Analysis of Text (NLP)
A word cloud indicating the preprocessed content is created. The most common words in the sustainability reports are indicated in the word cloud. This provides a brief visual overview of all the most discussed themes and topics in the reports like "climate change", "human right", "supply chain", "safety". The named entities are counted and the most common ones are shown. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the identification and classification of the entities such as organizations, locations, and dates. 
Exploring the most frequently occurring entities helps to get a glimpse of what specific organizations, places, or other entities are mentioned more frequently in the reports that may be related to their ESG activities and impacts. Sentiment analysis is carried out with VADER and TextBlob. Sentiment scores having the negative, neutral, positive, and compound which are tabulated on text that is already preprocessed. 
This can assist in decoding the overall key aspects of the reports with regard to the level of emotion. A strong positive sentiment would point to companies reporting in a positive way on their sustainability activities and differences may reflect different reporting styles or actual performance differences. Correlation between Total ESG Score and sentiment is represented by means of correlation plot. This examines the relationships between the overall ESG scores of a company and how this is reflected in the tone of the reports. A positive correlation may indicate that those companies that have good scores in ESG write more favorably about their sustainability activities.
The trend of mean ESG scores and sentiment is plotted yearly. This is used to compare the changes of ESG performance as well as sentiments on the reports on a time-based comparison showing the tendency or gaps in the results.

Topic Modeling (LDA)
The pre-processed text is then put through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which finds underlying topics that discuss the text in the reports. This will assist in revealing the major topics or themes addressed in the sustainability reports in addition to each word. The most frequent words in each of the found topics are shown. This gives a definite sense of what each topic entails such as Topic 0 could be connected to banking and finance, Topic 7 to mining and biodiversity. The prevailing theme of every document (report) is given. This is further classification of each report according to its main theme.
The increasing and decreasing trend of the prevailing subjects is studied and plotted. This indicates the projection with which various topics on sustainability have been covered as years passed. As an illustration of the potential use of such an analysis, an increasing percentage of documents about the term "climate change" observed over a period of years would demonstrate that there is an increasing emphasis on that topic in corporate reporting.

Best Practice Benchmarking
The most popular 10 tickers with respect to their average Total ESG Score are listed to focus n the companies who have the most positive reported ESG performance in the data set. Major sentiment and dominant topic data are combined with the top 10 tickers to enable the joint investigation of successful firms, their sentiment, and the critical themes to which they refer to. The visualization compares the average sentiment and most frequent topics of these top 10 companies to provide insights whether top performers adopt similar reporting style (sentiment), or focus on similar sustainability areas (topics). As an example, when several top-performing firms are linked by a strong positive sentiment, and their most prominent topic is associated with renewable energy, it may indicate that positive reports mean strong performance in the renewable sphere
Overall Practical Interpretation

This report gives a full picture of the ESG reporting scene in corporation sustainability reporting. Doing both quantitative ESG scores and qualitative text analysis, we are able to:
•	Gathering an overview of the overall state of ESG reporting by discovering the major insights into common themes, styles of reporting, and time trends.
•	Comparing company performance by contrasting the performance of individual companies against their ESG score and the content/tone of their reports.
•	Identify focus areas to find areas of greatest focus in terms of discussion or coverage in the reports.
•	Potentially reveal anomalies to place ESG scores next to the tone of reports to see whether positive reporting correlates with greater scores.
•	Follow what sustainability priorities from year-to-year change to watch how your interests in various topics vary over time.

Such information could assist investors, researchers, policymakers, and companies themselves in getting understand how corporate sustainability is performing, what are the best practices, and the progress of company sustainability objectives.
